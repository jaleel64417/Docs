  "title" : "JavaScript: The Good Parts",
  "author" : "Douglas Crockford",
  "language" : "JavaScript",
  "publishYear" : 2008,
  "summary" : "Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that's more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole—a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code."
